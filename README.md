# MCP AGENT MARKETPLACE

The MCP Agent Marketplace is a digital platform where people can easily find and use smart AI assistants — called “agents” — to help with everyday tasks. Instead of needing to understand coding or complex software, users can simply choose agents that fit their needs, like organizing data, managing emails, writing content, or automating work on their computer. Developers can also create and share their own agents here. In short, it’s like an app store — but for AI tools that make computers work smarter and faster for everyone.
