# Acknowledgement & Project Intent

This repository is a fork of **consomnius** and is built on top of that project's codebase.

## Our goal
We are converting this codebase into **MCP & Agent Marketplace for Non-Technical Users**. Our intent is to simplify agent creation, deployment, and usage so non-technical users can build and run agents and small automation workflows without needing deep engineering knowledge.

## License & Compliance
This project remains licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)** as inherited from consomnius. We acknowledge the original authors and comply with the terms of the AGPLv3:

- All modifications to the codebase will be published under AGPLv3.
- Contributors to this repository license their contributions under AGPLv3.
- If an organization or use case cannot comply with AGPLv3 (for example, closed-source SaaS usage with 11+ users), a commercial license from the original authors is required (contact: bd@cherry-ai.com).

## Contact & Contribution
